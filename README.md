# AccessControl
Access Control algorithm using RFID passive card reader
Programmed using arduino IDE.
MFRC 522 Card reader.

Read IDs of individuals and compare them with the preloaded values to id them.
The ID'd card is detected for entry or exit using flag variables and thus provide access to the card holder.
The counter is updated based on the status of the card. That is entry or exit.

Loops are used to identify the rfid data from the set. And the individual is identified using a seperate id
